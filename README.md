### Eat Da Burger! An MVC Node.js Wep APP

Eat da Burger was an exercise for me to practice MVC based architecture, while also practicing my skills in 
developing a Node.js based server app. MySQL was used to store data about burgers typed in by the user. Once 
that was done, I utilized GET and POST calls to the server that would store and display each burger in the database.
Handlebars was used to formualte HTML layouts.

### Eat Da Burger! An MVC Node.js Wep APP

[Eat Da Burger!](https://polar-bastion-52352.herokuapp.com/)

Eat da Burger was a recent project for me to practice developing an app using MVC based architecture, while also practicing my skills in developing a Node.js based server app. MySQL was used to store data about burgers typed in by the user. Once 
that was done, I utilized GET and POST calls to the server that would store and display each burger in the database.
Handlebars was used to formualte HTML layouts.
